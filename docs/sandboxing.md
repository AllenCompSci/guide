To set up assignments using the sandboxing method (a.k.a. "fake forks"):

### 1. Get an upgraded plan

See our [guide][private-repos] on getting private repositories to use in your class. You will need one private repository per student per assignment.

### 2. Set up the repositories

**Your students need to sign up for GitHub before you can grant them access to your organization.**

You have a few options for how to organize the repositories for your students.

#### Individual projects

For each student:

1. Create a repository in the organization based on the student's name.
1. Create a team in the organization, matching the name of the repository.
1. Set that team to have `Push/Pull` permissions.
1. Add the student to that team.
1. Give that team access to the corresponding repository.

#### Group projects

For each group:

1. Create a repository in the organization.
1. Create a team in the organization.
1. Set that team to have `Push/Pull` permissions.
1. Add all of the group members to that team.
1. Give that team access to the corresponding repository.
