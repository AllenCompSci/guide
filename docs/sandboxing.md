To set up assignments using the sandboxing method (a.k.a. "fake forks"):

### 1. Request free private repositories

GitHub is free for open source and paid for private use. We're happy to offer free private repositories to teachers using GitHub with students in a classroom setting â€“ just [submit a request][discount]. Note these requests take up to a week to process, so please **do this in advance**.

### 2. Set up the repositories

**Your students need to sign up for GitHub before you can grant them access to your organization.**

You have a couple options for how to organize the repositories for your students.

#### Individual projects

For each student:

1. Create a repository in the organization based on the student's name.
1. Create a team in the organization, matching the name of the repository.
1. Set that team to have `Push/Pull` permissions.
1. Add the student to that team.
1. Give that team access to the corresponding repository.

#### Group projects

For each group:

1. Create a repository in the organization.
1. Create a team in the organization.
1. Set that team to have `Push/Pull` permissions.
1. Add all of the group members to that team.
1. Give that team access to the corresponding repository.

### 3. Give access to others

You'll probably want to add all co-teachers, teaching assistants, graders, etc. to the Owners team of the organization, so that they will have access to all your students' work.
