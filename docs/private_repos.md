To use private repositories for your class:

### 1. Request free private repositories

GitHub is free for open source and paid for private use. We're happy to offer free private repositories to teachers using GitHub with students in a classroom setting â€“ just **[submit a request][discount] for an organization account** upgrade. Note these requests take up to a week to process, so please **do this in advance**.

### 2. Give access to others

You'll probably want to [add][help-add] all co-teachers, teaching assistants, graders, etc. to the Owners team in the organization, so that they will be able to access all repositories.

You can read more about [teams][help-add-to-team] and [access control][help-access-control] on GitHub Help.
