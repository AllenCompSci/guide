### 1. Sign up for GitHub

**If you already have a personal GitHub account, you can skip this step.**

GitHub has two types of accounts: [Personal and Organization][user-accounts]. To get started, you and each student/co-teacher will need to create a Personal account. Each individual user on GitHub should have exactly one Personal account. There's no need to maintain a separate account just for teaching, we'll use an Organization for that.

It's totally free to create an account, so go ahead and [sign up][signup].

### 2. Create an Organization for your class

**You must be logged in to GitHub to create an Organization account.**

A GitHub Organization represents a group of people working together, like a company or an open-source project. In this case, we'll use an Organization to represent your class in school. You can name your Organization anything you like. A common convention is to use some combination of the school name and course number. If you intend to repeat the course you may want to include the semester or year in the name.

[Create an organization][org-signup] for your class.

### 3. Post your syllabus

You may want to create a public repository with your syllabus and assignment description(s). That way, students can see any changes made over time and create issues to ask for clarifications, and other teachers can collaborate with you to make your materials even better.

See [an example course repository](https://github.com/afeld/advanced_js).

### 4. Set up the repositories

The easiest way to set up your class on GitHub is using forks, via [this guide][forks]. Note that structure means students will have access to one another's work, so if it's important that their assignments are hidden from one another, use our [sandboxing][sandboxing] guide instead. One thing to keep in mind is that there's no shortage of ways for students to share files with one another, so embracing collaboration and peer learning through [the forking method][forks] is encouraged :+1:

### 5. Get started with Git and GitHub

We have various resources available for Git and GitHub:

* [List of guides and tutorials][learning-materials] for learning how to use them
* [Open source training materials][teaching-materials] to you can use/customize for your classes
* [Git cheat sheet][cheat-sheet]
