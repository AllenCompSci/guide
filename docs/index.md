### 1. Sign up for GitHub

GitHub has two types of accounts: [personal user accounts and organization accounts][user-accounts]. To get started, you and each student/co-teacher will need to [create a personal account][signup], if you or they don't have one already. Each individual user on GitHub should have exactly one personal account. There's no need to maintain a separate account just for teaching, we'll use an organization for that.

It's totally free to create an account, so go ahead and [sign up][signup].

### 2. Create an organization for your class

**You must be logged into your personal GitHub account in order to create an organization account.**

A GitHub organization represents a group of people working together, like a company or an open-source project. In this case, we'll use an organization to represent your class in school. You can name your organization anything you like. A common convention is to use some combination of the school name and course number. If you intend to repeat the course, you may want to include the semester or year in the name.

[Create an organization][org-signup] for your class.

### 3. Post your syllabus

You may want to create a repository with your syllabus and assignment description(s). That way, students can see any changes made over time and create issues to ask for clarifications. If the repository is public, other teachers can collaborate with you to make your materials even better.

See [an example course repository](https://github.com/afeld/advanced_js).

### 4. Set up the repositories

There are two options for how to structure the repositories for your class:

#### [Forks][forks]

* Anyone who can see the base repository can see all forks, i.e. all students can see one another's work.
* Different solutions can be cross-referenced, encouraging peer learning.
* Pull requests can be used for submission and code review.
* Ideal for collaborative assignments, which can act like open source projects.

#### [Sandboxing][sandboxing]

* Individuals can only see repositories when explicitly given access, i.e. students are blocked from seeing one another's work.
* Requires manual repository and permission setup.

Forking & collaborating is how we work at GitHub, and how many other companies and open source projects work. Rather than trying to restrict visibility between students, embracing the potential of them learning from one another's work (through [the forking method][forks]) is encouraged :mortar_board:

### 5. Get started with Git and GitHub

We have various resources available for Git and GitHub:

* [List of guides and tutorials][learning-materials] for learning how to use them
* [Open source training materials][teaching-materials] to you can use/customize for your classes
* [Git cheat sheet][cheat-sheet]

If you or your students don't have a lot of experience with the command-line, check out [GitHub for Mac][ghfm] and [GitHub for Windows][ghfw].
