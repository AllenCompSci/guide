To have students complete assignments using forks:

### 1. Create the repositories

**Create one repository per assignment**, including any boilerplate files the students will need to get started.

### 2. Completing assignments

The students then follow these steps for each assignment:

1. To start, [**fork the repository**][forking]
1. Clone the repository to your computer
1. Modify the files and commit changes to complete your solution
1. Push/sync the changes up to GitHub
1. [Create a pull request][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment

You may consider making a context-specific copy of them in your syllabus or assignment description.

### 3. Reviewing assignments

As a teacher, you can then do code review within the pull request, giving line-by-line feedback.  If you allow them to do corrections, they can then push fixes up to their repository, which will be reflected in the pull request. No need to actually merge the pull request, since you don't want the solution in the original repository â€“ just close the pull request and give them a :+1: (`:+1:`).
