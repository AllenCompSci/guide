### 1. Sign up for GitHub

**If you already have a personal GitHub account, you can skip this step.**

GitHub has two types of accounts: Personal and Organization. To get started, you'll need to create a Personal account. Each individual user on GitHub should have exactly one Personal account. There's no need to maintain a separate account just for teaching, we'll use an Organization for that.

It's totally free to create an account, so go ahead and [sign up][signup].

### 2. Create an Organization for your class

**You must be logged in to GitHub to create an Organization account.**

A GitHub Organization represents a group of people working together, like a company or an open-source project. In this case, we'll use an Organization to represent your class in school. You can name your Organization anything you like. A common convention is to use some combination of the school name and course number. If you intend to repeat the course you may want to include the semester or year in the name.

[Create an organization][org-signup] for your class.

### 3. Request free private repositories

**You only need the discount if you want to keep your students' code private.**

GitHub is free for open source and paid for private use. We're happy to offer free private repositories to teachers using GitHub with students in a classroom setting.

If you would like your students' code to remain private, [request a discount][discount].

### 4. Give your students access using Teams

**Your students need to sign up for GitHub before you can grant them access to your Organization.**

You can manage access to your Organization using Teams. The most common use of Teams is to group students together for project work. You can manage the access permissions for each Team independently, that way you can decide who has access to what code. It's also useful to create a Team for teaching assitants with full access to all code in the Organzization.

You can read more about [Teams][help-team] and [access control][help-access-control] on GitHub Help.
